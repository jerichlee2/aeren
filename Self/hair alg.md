// STYLING ROUTINE // 

PREP: 
- STMNT Grooming Spray 
- Get Hair Damp 
BLOWDRY: 
- SMNT Matte Paste 
- Rough Dry to about 75-80% 
- Heat sections of hair and scrunch to "bend" the hair 
- Bends will create natural separation and texture 
STYLE: 
- Use the product residue in your hands 
- Define the ends and start detailing until you like what you see 

*Depending on your length of hair, styling routine should be no more than 10-15 min 

** Yes, you do have 10-15 min to style your hair. If you just want to admit that you're lazy af, then just say that lol 

*** No, I don't expect most people to style their hair everyday. I wear a hat most days but at least I know how to style my hair when it matters (ie. night out, date, weddings, etc.) // SOCIAL // @deltahair @fernwoodbarbers
