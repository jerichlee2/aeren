Hello Grandpa,

It is great to hear from you too. 

I am glad to hear that you have been doing well. I know that mom and Reinah are very excited to see you in Korea this summer.

Real Analysis has been a great challenge so far, I have been spending a lot of time learning how to formulate proofs. Taking this class has taught me to think abstractly, which has vastly improved my mathematical reasoning and engineering abilities. 

I have spent time constructing the Natural Numbers from the Peano Axioms, and also constructing the Real numbers using Dedekind Cuts. I am learning about epsilon-delta proofs also. I spent much of my days thinking about sequences and series, with the goal of understanding how to manipulate functions.

I am planning on taking Complex Analysis this fall during my senior year. I will look into Point Set Topology and Graph Theory, which are offered at my university.

I wanted to let you know that after I work as an engineer, I wish to return to graduate school in Pure Mathematics. 

I am interested in mathematical logic, as I have been fascinated by the works of Kurt GÃ¶del, David Hilbert, and Georg Cantor. I also wish to learn more about mathematical analysis, particularly the Lebesgue Integration method and infinite dimensional vector spaces. 

Thank you for being my role model in my intellectual journey in my life. I miss you incredibly, and I cannot wait to study maths when I see you again. I love you Grandpa.

Love,

Jerich Lee
