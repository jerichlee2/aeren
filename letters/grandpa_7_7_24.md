Hi Jerich, 
what's up?

My favorite field  was the optimization in "Operations Research" such as linear programming and non linear programming applied in industrial engineering.

Linear Programming is a kind of boundary value problems in two variables that find to optimize or minimize in a given constraints.

There is called linear system with several variables. 
If there are n equations with n variables, we can solve the linear system easily, but if the number of variables is more than the number of equations, is not easy. That kind of problems are called linear programming. 
Usually to find a solution in a linear equation system with enough several variables more than the number of its equatons, we usually use a computer to find the solution. 

Here we use "Simplex Method" to find the solution of linear equation system with several variables  such as maximization or minimization problems.

We apply linear programming problem for several areas such as Applied Mathematics, Management Science, and so on.

As you know I already retired my job, I don't teach or study any more since 2006.
Taking a day is my matter everyday by riding a bike.

That's it.

My lovely grandson, Jerich, I think you will be good at your major areas because ulyou are smart and young.

Do your best all the time, and never give up in any situations and circumstances.

Beat Wishes.
