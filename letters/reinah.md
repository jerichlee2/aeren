Hi Reinah, I hope you've been doing well. I wanted to see how you were doing, and let you know that I'm working hard this summer. I'm working full time at CAT and also taking a graduate math class, which has been fulfilling but consuming. I wanted to let you know that I'm coming back to PV on August 2nd, and that I'm so excited to see you. I love you Reinah!
