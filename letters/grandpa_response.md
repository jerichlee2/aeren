Dear Grandpa,

Thank you for your carefully crafted response. I never knew that you were not only a pure mathematician, but you also were an applied one; you used the tools of mathematics to solve real world, engineering solutions. Studying engineering for the past few years has given me a deep appreciation for the tools of mathematics—the ability to abstract these tools to real world problems instills great meaning in my life.

I have never heard of Linear Programming, but the field reminds me of certain problems in data analysis and statistics; e.g., using the Singular Value Decomposition in Linear Algebra to truncate an asymmetric matrix to be able to solve systems with more variables than equations. 

I will look into the field of Linear Programming. Engineering is all about the ability to condense, transform, and communicate data. There is a problem in Fluid Mechanics—to have a clean, analytical solution to the 3D Navier-Stokes Equations (Newton's Laws for Fluids) that has long fascinated me. Although we cannot prove that such equations exist, we can use computers to use numerical methods to solve these equations to a certain accuracy. I use these tools at my job everyday to analyze the structural integrity of hydraulic cylinders. 

Optimization is such a beautiful field. I have been interested in the mathematics behind Machine Learning, and the entire field is contingent upon the power of the gradient. It is amazing to me that we can program a computer to "learn" to solve problems. 

We can abstract a neuron of the brain using a neural network. This network consists of input, intermediate, and output nodes. These nodes can be further abstracted using matrices. To "train" a network to return a specific output (e.g. the inputs can be a pictures of members of the Lee family, and the output returns the name), we build a cost function of the entire network, which takes in each node of the network as an input, and return a single number. This number is the "cost", or how good/bad the network is at guessing the name of the Lee family member. 

By performing an operation called "Backpropagation", every time the cost function is computed, we can compute the gradients at each node of the network, then adjust the entire network along the directions of these values to minimize the "loss" of the entire network. As the return value of the cost function approaches zero, the network becomes better and better at guessing the names of our family from an image. 

My vision is that industries with large manufacturing operations such as Caterpillar, SpaceX, Tesla, will all utilize the power of Machine Learning to produce complex machines efficiently and autonomously. We are seeing Tesla building robots that emulate human dexterity, which may replace many mechanics and technicians who assemble these large machines. This means less injuries in the workforce—but it also means less jobs. 

Using mathematics to be able to abstract human intelligence is an exciting, yet uncertain period of my life. I am unsure if my job will be replaced by a machine in the future. Machine Learning can be very useful to humanity; but it is only a tool—that of which can be used for good—but also for bad. 

There is a field within Machine Learning called "Alignment", which is dedicated to understand how to "align" Machine Learning to best fit the needs for humanity. This begs the question of philosophy: what does it mean for a Machine to think?

I know that as long as I continue to put deep focus and effort into the study of pure mathematics, I will be able to contribute to any field. The theorems of mathematics are the pillars of the universe. I will always question, learn, and be social. 

Thank you for your perpetual love. I am glad to hear that you are being active. I have also taken up cycling, which I do while I am at school. I love you so much Grandpa. 

Love,

Jerich
