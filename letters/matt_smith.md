Hey Matt, I hope you've been well. I know you've been working hard this summer, and just wanted to let you know that I've been working hard too. CAT is good, but I'm also taking MATH 444--Real Analysis; I have decided that I want to pursue graduate school in mathematics eventually after my engineering career. It's been difficult, but immensely fulfilling for me.

The people are interesting here, we've got a good mix of people from all over the midwest--Michigan, Iowa, Missouri. I've gotten along with them well, but they don't seem to understand my West Coast mannerisms--sigh. It's tough being Rico out here; but sometimes he slips out and becomes the life of the party.

I've been taking my time reading Gödel, Escher, Bach, and I've finally reached the halfway point after ~3 months. It's a masterpiece to me--mathematics, art, music, philosophy--they are all one. I've expressed an interest in poetry, and I've been reading the works of T.S. Eliot; his magnum opus--The Waste Land paints imagery of a dystopian world with great references to classic Latin, French, and German literature. 

I hope your family is doing well. I have and will always appreciate you and your family's warm hospitality. Thank you for being there for me. I won't be coming down for Greek Reunion this summer, but I will see you this fall. Run it back then. 

“Always keep faith in yourself, keep going and stay strong.   
Never give up on your dreams and never give up hope.”
