2024-08-04,2:00 PM,7:00 PM,first pass completing micrograd--andrej karpathy,,
2024-08-05,8:00 AM,11:02 AM,worked on aeren,"got entry apps working! i want to learn how to control my streams of data to a desired output...what do i need to learn to understand this? control theory perhaps? I also want to balance learning from andej's ai series...so much to learn, so much to do, never enough time!",
2024-08-05,2:00 PM,6:00 PM,aeren,aeren…will implement fitbit features soon…,
2024-08-05,8:52 PM,10:30 PM,"working on karpathy's makemore lecture 1, or NNZTH lecture 2!",31:08 timestamp on makemore pt1,
2024-08-07,8:19 AM,11:17 AM,makemore continuation," 1:05:35 building makemore, learned about broadcasting tensors, establishing the negative log likelihood (log of the probabilities of each letter pair in a word times -1) as a loss function, and now I am going to build this model in the framework of a neural net...micrograd will come in handy for this, i'm assuming that we will build a MLP that will compute backprop wrt our loss (-log(likelihood)) for each weight in our MLP according to input bigrams",

2024-08-10,10:00 AM,11:48 AM,finally learned 4bld and 5bld...time to execute,"will attempt 4bld today, 5bld tomorrow",
2024-08-10,8:20 PM,11:37 PM,4bld.,"did 4bld in 8 min, time for 5bld tomorrow.",
2024-08-11,8:34 AM,11:29 AM,5bld off by three wings,,
