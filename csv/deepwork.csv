2024-08-04,8:00 AM,12:00 PM,worked on aeren,
2024-08-04,2:00 PM,7:00 PM,first pass completing micrograd--andrej karpathy,
2024-08-05,8:00 AM,11:02 AM,worked on aeren,"got entry apps working! i want to learn how to control my streams of data to a desired output...what do i need to learn to understand this? control theory perhaps? I also want to balance learning from andej's ai series...so much to learn, so much to do, never enough time!"
2024-08-05,2:00 PM,6:00 PM,aeren,aeren…will implement fitbit features soon…
2024-08-05,8:52 PM,10:30 PM,"working on karpathy's makemore lecture 1, or NNZTH lecture 2!",31:08 timestamp on makemore pt1
2024-08-07,8:19 AM,11:17 AM,makemore continuation," 1:05:35 building makemore, learned about broadcasting tensors, establishing the negative log likelihood (log of the probabilities of each letter pair in a word times -1) as a loss function, and now I am going to build this model in the framework of a neural net...micrograd will come in handy for this, i'm assuming that we will build a MLP that will compute backprop wrt our loss (-log(likelihood)) for each weight in our MLP according to input bigrams"
2024-08-08,8:29 AM,10:00 AM,makemore part 1,
2024-08-09,7:50 AM,11:00 AM,aeren,
2024-08-09,3:25 PM,6:00 PM,aeren fitbit api,
2024-08-09,9:14 PM,10:55 PM,makemore continued,"finished makemore p1, started makemore MLP "
2024-08-10,10:00 AM,11:48 AM,finally learned 4bld and 5bld...time to execute,"will attempt 4bld today, 5bld tomorrow"
2024-08-10,8:20 PM,11:37 PM,4bld.,"did 4bld in 8 min, time for 5bld tomorrow."
2024-08-11,8:34 AM,11:29 AM,5bld off by three wings,
2024-08-12,9:08 AM,1:00 PM,work in progress...,
2024-08-13,8:21 PM,10:00 PM,makemore p2 MLP,finished makemore p2!
2024-08-14,9:49 AM,10:41 AM,makemore p3,halfway thru makemore p3
2024-08-26,7:30 PM,10:44 PM,real analysis--going over the construction of the natural numbers,"covered peano axioms+addition, plan is to go over peano, addition, mulitplication, ordering in first lecture video on wasteful"
2024-08-27,3:03 PM,6:28 PM,math 447 and course setup,"finished Set Theory chapter in Tao's Analysis I...thinking about adding new features to entering deepwork & reading—i.e.—adding tags (book data [title, author]), course..."
2024-08-28,11:50 AM,12:45 PM,going over lecture 2 stuff,oops
2024-08-28,08:29 PM,,working on aeren + math,
