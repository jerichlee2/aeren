8/4/24,2:00 PM,7:00 PM,first pass completing micrograd--andrej karpathy,
8/5/24,8:00 AM,11:02 AM,worked on aeren,"got entry apps working! i want to learn how to control my streams of data to a desired output...what do i need to learn to understand this? control theory perhaps? I also want to balance learning from andej's ai series...so much to learn, so much to do, never enough time!"

8/6/24,8:19 AM,11:17 AM,makemore continuation," 1:05:35 building makemore, learned about broadcasting tensors, establishing the negative log likelihood (log of the probabilities of each letter pair in a word times -1) as a loss function, and now I am going to build this model in the framework of a neural net...micrograd will come in handy for this, i'm assuming that we will build a MLP that will compute backprop wrt our loss (-log(likelihood)) for each weight in our MLP according to input bigrams"
